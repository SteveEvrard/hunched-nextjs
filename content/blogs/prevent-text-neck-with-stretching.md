In the era of smartphones and constant connectivity, text neck has become an all-too-common issue. This modern condition is caused by the repetitive strain on the neck muscles from looking down at screens for extended periods. While the problem is widespread, the solution is within reach—regular stretching. Stretching not only alleviates the symptoms of text neck but also helps prevent it from occurring in the first place.

The muscles in your neck and upper back are prone to tightening and weakening due to prolonged device usage. Stretching these muscles helps maintain their flexibility and strength, reducing the strain on your cervical spine. Simple stretches, such as the chin tuck or side neck stretch, can ease the tension that builds up throughout the day and promote better posture. By making stretching a regular habit, you can protect yourself from the discomfort and potential long-term effects of text neck.
